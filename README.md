## Keylogger
This python script, when ran, will log keystrokes into a file called log.txt. The keystrokes will be captured whenever a key is pressed (not just when typing into the terminal).

# Usage
For the script to work, you will need a virtual environment running with the dependency `pynput` installed.
run `python3 ./keylogger.pyw` and watch the magic happen.
